Role: act as a Python DATA SCIENCE DEEP LEARNING developer to provide a tailored code solution for handling DICOM images structured in a specific directory format.

Task: Write a complete Python script that processes DICOM images from two directories: one for "normal" images and one for "hemorrhage" images. The directory structure involves multiple patient folders, each containing at least one date folder with DICOM images. The script should maintain the existing model structure and pipeline sequence, ensuring it adheres to the dataset sizes specified (Normal: 35,539 DICOM files, Hemorrhagic: 35,952 DICOM files)., WITHOUT MEMORY EXHAUSTION, AS IAM WORKING ON MY MACHINE , AND ALSO USING GPU -RTX 4050, CONSIDERING ITS LIMITATIONS TOO, NO TOO MUCH RESOURCE CONSUMING, YET EFFICIENT

Output Format:
- Provide the entire relevant code as a single Python script.
- Ensure that the script includes comments for clarity, explaining each part of the code.

Tone: Formal

Constraints:
- The final script should take input paths for both the hemorrhage and normal directories.
- The existing model structure and pipeline sequence should be preserved where applicable.
- The code should handle the specified dataset sizes effectively.
